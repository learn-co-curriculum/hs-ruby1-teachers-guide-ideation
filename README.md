## Unit 9: Ideation

### SWBATs
+ Understand the brainstorming and design process and decide on an idea for their final project.

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ We’ve all been in the situation where we want to make something, but are totally overwhelmed by the blank page. The blinking cursor of nothingness. It’s totally daunting. Since we’re going to start working on our final projects, we’re going to first tackle the brainstorming process so that we have a few potential projects that we can work on. The point of this course is to learn to build web applications, combining front-end programming with back-end programming, but you can't build an application about nothing. You need a good idea, first!

### Lesson Plan
+ Explain the constraints of the project

### Conclusion / So What?
+ Now that you have the full power of Git and GitHub at your fingertips, collaborating with other developers is fully within your capabilities. This means you can work on some of the hottest coding projects out there, like Rails or Sinatra, and submit pull requests that could result in your code being incorporated into the code base. And when it comes to applying for coding jobs down the road, employers love to see that you've contributed to open source projects.

### Hints and Hurdles
+ `git add/commit/push` - FREEZE everyone and have them do this every 15 minutes to build up the muscle memory.
